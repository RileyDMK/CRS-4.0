        <p>Music teaching is my primary business. When you enroll in my studio I will be 
        reserving time for you on a regular basis. I expect every student to come to their
        lesson having practiced the assigned materials and in a state of mind, and
        health, to accept direction. If practice has been limited I still want the student to 
        come for a lesson. I strive for proactive communications when needed for 
        cancellations and other correspondence. I expect that assigned music and 
        materials are brought with the student to each lesson and taken home at the end
        of each lesson.
        </br></br>
        You can expect a welcoming and comfortable studio, and appreciation for the
        effort you make to travel to Country Road Studio. You can expect a teacher who 
        is prepared for your lesson, focused entirely on what you need to enhance your 
        musical education. You can expect suitable materials to be explored and 
        assigned as your needs and talents evolve.
