        <p>There is no standard by which to evaluate a prospective music teacher other
          than criteria one might find on an internet site, which I recommend you research. If lessons are for you, the first
          thing you need to do is decide two things: (1) what music do you want to play (make a list); and, (2) what will you give
          up each day in order to make room for practicing?  If lessons are for your child do the following: (1) if you’ve
          noticed a proclivity for music making by your child, and the child expresses an interest in learning to play, remain
          detached from the notion that he/she is a budding prodigy (that puts too much stress on the child); (2) determine when
          your child will practice between lessons (by the way, if your child is involved in 3 - 5 other extracurricular activities,
          we should talk about that.); (3) you must have an instrument that inspires; and, (4) you must be realistic and know that the money you spend on piano lessons is likely well spent
          but you must accept the end result of those lessons (not every child will be invited to Carnegie Hall).
            <br /><br />
            <!-- Finally, you want a teacher who can play well and show what good musicianship looks and sounds like.
            You want someone who can impart the secret of turning pages full of black note heads into a moving experience.
            <br /><br />
            If you’re thinking that’s what it may be about for you, or for someone close to you, then we should get together soon for a free consultation.
            It could be the start of something special!

        <p>I’ve been a teacher of piano, keyboard and other musical skills in the Inland Northwest
          full time for the past 10 years (part-time before that in other places). I’ve studied music all of my life, well at least since
          the second grade when my mother signed me up for lessons. Keep in mind, I was a boy and now I’m a man, a man who plays the piano
          because he didn’t quit and become one of the other boys who did quit. That was over 50 years ago but I stuck with it.
          The girls liked it. I even majored in music, first at what was then called North Texas State University (the place where
          jazz education started) and then did a masters in music at Southern Methodist University. My goal for my students is to equip them with the skills they need to become musically literate,
          able in the future to learn and play well on their own without the aid of a teacher.
          <br /><br />
          My students range in age from 7 to 70+. Some come with a specific goal, others ready to explore the possibilities.
          Some would like to join their school jazz band, others would like to play from the Great American Songbook (jazz standards, as well as pop, rock, and more).
          Some want to compose their own music; others want to play the music of other composers.
          <br /><br />
          I’m successful when my students know that they’ve become musically literate.
          That means, in part, that they know how to breathe life into music they compose or reproduce.
          They know how to practice effectively. They feel the excitement that comes from ending a performance with a flair, of realizing what they’ve accomplished,
          and enjoying the accolades of others.
          <br /><br />
          I’m also successful when my students’ parents (or adult students) feel that they’ve received their money’s worth.
          It’s tough for many to know what they’re getting for the tuition they pay. I strive to ensure accountability for my teaching.

      <div  id="a2-more" class="collapse">
        <p>I teach with the idea that music is a language. That what we use to express ourselves when we talk is akin
          to what a musician does to express musical meaning. Playing an instrument is a matter of the head and the heart - a
          balance of the two - and I teach with that in mind.  I believe that rhythm is the bones of the musical body,
          that without an understanding of how to make sense of rhythm one cannot make music. So I put great emphasis on
          this with all my students as they learn other musical fundamentals.
          <br /><br />
          I try to meet every student, new or otherwise, where they are that day.  For most I can’t just launch into the lesson.
          When I do I ensure they are warmed up, as relaxed as can be but attentive to the matters at hand. After all I’m being
          paid for this and I’m excited about what my students can learn. I expect them to have come prepared and that means
          they’ve practiced effectively, often enough to learn whatever was previously assigned, and ready to gain insights on
          how their music making can be even better.
          <br /><br />
          Lessons at Country Road Studio are taught primarily on a Yamaha Clavinova.
          This instrument replicates well the sound and touch of an acoustic grand or upright piano while offering added advantages such as making recordings of lesson accomplishments for future reference.
          For some students interested in playing keyboard in a performing small band I offer training on a Nord Stage 2 and a Roland Jupiter.

      <div id="a4-more" class="collapse">
        <p>My mother wanted me to be a doctor. Doctors abide by the Hippocratic Oath which goes something similar to my lofty
          teaching philosophy statement which I’m assuming you just read. That’s as close as I came professionally to pleasing my
          mother but, like most all mothers, she was proud of me and I’m sure glad that all those years ago she called me in from
          playing football with the guys and had me practice boogie-woogie and Beethoven.
          <br /><br />
          Seriously now, my students present themselves at each lesson in a state of vulnerability. The little voices in their
          heads are ready to criticize them for mistakes even before I have a chance to do so. I simply adopt the strategy of
          the One Minute Manager: praise approximate success. This is no time for judgmental or egotistical behavior on my part.
          My philosophy includes making them feel glad that they came to their lesson, listen for and praise incremental minor
          improvements, share my expectation that effective practice has occurred between lessons (and have a chat if it hasn’t)
          and to nurture each student in the skills necessary to become competent musicians.
          <br /><br />
          Finally, philosophically speaking, it is my belief that if we’re lucky enough to live a long and productive life,
          those of us who have tended regularly to the “artist within”, who have learned to play the piano, or any musical instrument,
          will look back with a great sense of satisfaction that we brought joy into our life and into the lives of others through
          the music we made. I know that’s how I feel after nearly 60 years of making music.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- Of the many benefits from learning to make music, there is one that is often overlooked.  Making music can promote self-integration,
          that feeling we get when key aspects of ourselves feel in harmony with each other. It’s when we’re “in the zone.”  The aspects I refer
          to are our emotions and our thoughts. Music making constantly integrates feeling with thought. Building technical skills at the piano demands concentration.
          Interpreting music in such a way that it touches the listener involves our emotions. This continuous coordination of reason and emotion,
          I would go so far as to say, epitomizes the order and harmony we seek in ourselves and in our relationships with others.

          <p><br><strong>Seven reasons for considering piano lessons as an adult.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              Reason #1 - Because adult piano learning can reduce stress.
              <br /><br />
              We all need to reduce stress in our daily lives!  
              Imagine just sitting down and playing a piano instead of taking another handful of pills?  
              Studies have shown that in many adults “playing the piano was the most effective activity in reducing cortisol levels.”
              <br /><br />
              Reason #2 - Because adult piano learning can help make you healthier. 
              <br /><br />
              By reducing stress levels, you can also decrease your risk of developing stress related illnesses, 
              for example heart disease. When you’ve arrive at the point of being able for fluently play the piano 
              it will make you happy. Happy people have increased blood flow. Increased blood flow helps prevent 
              vascular diseases that can be life threatening.
              <br /><br />
              Reason #3 - Because adult piano learning can build your self confidence.
              The sense of accomplishment that you receive, as an adult, from learning to play music, 
              is something that you can rarely find in other ways.  Learning the piano takes perseverance.  
              After a while you may just notice that you’re ability to stick with other avenues of learning improves.
              <br /><br />
              Reason #4 - Because adult piano learning can increase memory.
              <br /><br />
              Researchers, at Northwestern University, “studied music training’s effect on neuroplasticity, 
              defined as the brain’s ability to adapt and change as a result of training and experience over 
              the course of a person’s life” and found that “The effect of music training suggests that, akin 
              to physical exercise and its impact on body fitness, music is a resource that tones the brain for 
              auditory fitness,” the study said. Now don’t forget that.
              <br /><br />
              Reason #5 - Because playing the piano can help your emotional state and hormones. 
              <br /><br />
              As we age, and life changes, we deal with ever changing emotions and hormonal changes.  
              Particularly in women around the age of menopause, playing the piano can help with mood 
              swings by increasing HgH, relieving stress, and increasing those GOOD feelings in yourself.  
              Mastering the art of playing an instrument is a joy and the overall satisfaction it brings 
              can be a real boost to your emotional state!
              <br /><br />
              Reason #6 - Because it’s FUN! 
              <br /><br />
              Learning to play music at the piano, especially the music you love, is a very rewarding, 
              and probably LESS challenging experience than you think.  Many people report that they truly 
              enjoy the process and that the gratification of being able to sit down and play for themselves, 
              their family and friends is motivation enough.
