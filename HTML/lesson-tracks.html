            <h2>Recreational</h2>
            <p>This track is for those whose primary goal is to take it at their own pace,
            for those who may have taken music lessons years ago and want to have
            another go at it, and for those who just want to see if they like it enough
            to get serious. It’s also for parents/guardians hoping their child will “take
            to” music lessons.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Artist Preparatory</h2>
            <p>This track is for students who are serious about learning, practicing, and performing, who envision themselves advancing beyond 
            the beginner stage. It’s for those who want to learn to be musicians of depth, and who are willing to organize their time for 
            effective practice and preparation for each lesson.</p>
