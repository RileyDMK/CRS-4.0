      <p>I teach with the underlying goal that one day my students will no longer need a teacher
      but will have been taught the skills to tackle new music knowing how to approach it with confidence,
      practice it effectively, and perform it well enough to experience the joy that comes from that accomplishment.</p>

        <i>"Mr.Stuart tailors his lessons to each student’s learning style while while still teaching all the basic components
            of being a pianist. When he realized I didn’t work well with lesson books, he gave me pieces that had the same
              technique so that I could still learn, progress and enjoy playing!" - Abby M.</i>

        <p>After ten years of teaching at Music City in Spokane,
            and having moved to a new home and barn near Rathdrum, ID, it made sense to
            open a new music studio here and offer lessons to my new neighbors. Country
            Road Studio is situated within my new barn.  You’ll find it convenient to Hwy 95,
            just down a country road.  Click the Contact button for more on my location.
         Now that I have moved my home to North Idaho, it made sense to open a studio 
        here on our tree farm, just down a country road.</p>
