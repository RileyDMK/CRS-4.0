          <p class="testimonial">“Six years of our daughter working with Bryan has proven effective. 
            She is maturing as a performer, her sight reading continues to improve and she knows how to approach any 
            new piece of music without frustration. She’s become musically literate and an enthusiastic performer!” - Holly P.

      <p>You may be one of those who have questions that relate to whether piano lessons are worthwhile and worth the money.
      If you will click Read More below I’ve provided my opinions on some of the frequently asked questions that I’ve heard over the years.
      My opinions apply not only to piano and electric keyboard, but to singing and learning to play any instrument.

      <p>Before I enroll my child in piano lessons, what should I do?”</p>
      <p>Most parents can “pick up” on a child’s tendency to sing or want to play an instrument, especially if the parent is
        musical and/or has music playing in the home. If this is your situation I urge you to avoid the tendency to tell your
        child how great he/she is or how wonderful some little ditty they’ve just plunked out is. Instead, ask them open-ended questions
        about what they like about making music.  Help them make it their idea that they want to take lessons.
        If you are simply unable to refrain from thinking that your child is the next child prodigy, you may be in for some disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing with this answer, you should not only ask around for teacher referrals, but try to get invited over to talk with
        the “piano” parent at their home.  If possible ask their child to play something.  If the child readily accepts the request,
        chances are there’s a good teacher involved.
      </p>

        “I’m an adult and I’ve always wanted to play the piano.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement has a question implied and having taught many adults I feel qualified to weigh in on the issue. Four things that
        stymie most adults upon which you can reflect: (1) the voice in their heads that says something like “I’m THIS old and I can’t
        even play this simple song?”; (2) assuming that it will come easily without too much practice; (3) having never acquired a sense
        of rhythm and therefore cannot understand how rhythm organizes otherwise random notes into recognizable music; and, (4) playing
        “twister” on the keyboard (not believing that there is any need to use a certain fingering that makes playing more successful).
      </p>
      <p>
        What are a few success factors to consider?
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been my experience that those who are successful exhibit most of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>They are inwardly motivated to play music that turns them on.</li>
        <li>They take direction well.</li>
        <li>They carve out time in their busy schedules for the required practice between lessons.</li>
        <li>They come regularly to lessons as prepared as they can
                be.  If practice time hasn’t been available prior to a lesson,
                the student comes anyway for related musical training.</li>
        <li>They practice at home on an appropriate instrument.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition I have found that the most successful students are those with a good, if not solid, sense of rhythm.
          Rhythm, the organization of sound in time, serves as the skeleton on which the body of the music is sculpted.
          Some come to music lessons already possessing a strong sense of rhythm.  Others have to work extra hard at it.
          Then there are those who refuse to grasp this concept.  You’ve met them.  They say, “I used to take music lessons but I quit.”</p>
