      <div>
        <p>I teach with the underlying goal that one day my students will no longer need a teacher
        but will have been taught the skills to tackle new music knowing how to approach it with confidence,
        practice it effectively, and perform it well enough to experience the joy that comes from that accomplishment.</p>
