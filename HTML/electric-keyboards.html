        <p>The electric keyboards I use in my studio have several advantages for my students. 
        They have weighted keys, which means they
        offer the same level of resistance as would a traditional piano. 
        The resistance is what allows you to play
		dynamics (e.g. louder or softer), and enables the development of finger strength
		and agility needed to advance as a pianist.
        They are capable of producing hundreds of unique sounds that often inspire a 
        student to get creative for playing and composing their own music as well. 
        The portability of an electric keyboard is an obvious advantage and they never 
        go out of tune! Finally, their smaller footprint and reasonable price range can 
        make them a perfect solution for beginning students as well as musicians looking 
        to expand their performance opportunities.</p>
