      <p>The ukulele is a get-happy and versatile instrument that is enjoying 
      a well-deserved renaissance. With only four strings, learning to play 
      the ukulele is easier than the guitar, but learning it first can help 
      you make the transition to guitar much easier if that’s your goal.</br></br>
      Ukes come in four sizes and ranges: Tenor, Baritone, Concert and Soprano. 
      If you haven’t bought your uke yet I can help you with that decision.</br></br>
      I’ll have you playing popular and classic
      songs that you particularly love. I’ll help you determine whether the song is “in
      your range” in case you want to sing along and, if it’s not in your range , how to
      change the key.

      <p>“Bryan really brought music back into my life.
          Starting piano at age 54 was a challenge, but with Bryan, it all made sense!
          Nowadays I’ve gone back to playing guitar and Bryan even inspired me to take
          up ukulele!"  - Tom W.
