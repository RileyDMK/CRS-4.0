            <p>You should assume that taking piano lessons
            will be fun and challenging. Your teacher’s
            responsibility is to see that lessons are enjoyable and productive. Some
            students learn best with a defined course of study; others may thrive in a
            less structured environment. My teaching is personalized to each student.</p>

                <p>I’ve found it best to begin a new student with a six-month trial period. 
                During that period I’ll draw on my many years of experience to determine 
                whether the student is a good match for my teaching style.</p>
                <p>Here are several qualities I look for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The student loves music and wants to make music. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The student takes direction well.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The student commits to a practice routine and comes to lessons
                            prepared.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The student will have access to
                            an acoustic piano that is in tune and well regulated or to an electric keyboard
                            with a minimum of 76 keys and a weighted action (i.e. keys that offer resistance,
                            like a common piano, not like the keys of an organ.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>  
                </p></br>
                <p>I teach so that my students can read music, count rhythms, practice productively, 
                and play with feeling and confidence. Eventually, students will be able to pick 
                up a piece of music and know how to learn it themselves. </p>
