                jazz - comping and soloing closer to how it should be done -
                or even accompanying a jazz choir, I may be able to help.

                    I’m aware that in the jazz ensembles of middle schools, junior and senior high schools, public and private throughout our area, there is often a need for
                    a pianist who can interpret a jazz chart and get up-to-speed quickly.  By “interpret” I mean they can comp and solo with some authenticity, both in terms of voicing chords,
                    comping collaboratively, and soloing with swinging licks.

                    Many of the piano students recruited for jazz bands study with excellent teachers; however, many of those teachers don’t have jazz band experience or a
                    familiarity with voicing simple-to-complex jazz chords. My purpose is not to usurp the student’s current piano teacher.  It is, rather, to augment and add
                    value to their teaching by helping them with the charts they’ve been assigned.  I work with jazz students to learn “go-to” left hand chord voicings, utilizing
                    the work of Fred Hughes’ Left Hand Voicings and Chord Theory; to know how to add extensions with the right hand utilizing Frank Mantooth’s Voicings for Jazz Keyboard;
                    and, how to construct workable solos based on their knowledge of certain scales and modes.  Each lesson includes some listening to a jazz great play a solo or comp
                    with a band along with the use of backing tracks for practice purposes.

                    If you find yourself with an enthusiastic keyboard player and you’d like them to be more adept in your rhythm section, please give me a call and let’s discuss it.
                    I can fill you in on other tools I use to teach jazz piano.  By the way, I can also help if you have a pianist accompanying a jazz choir.
                    Although that usually involves sight reading it also involves swinging and that can be tricky.  Finally, if we moved forward I would want to call
                    your student’s current piano teacher as a courtesy and to be sure my involvement would not complicate matters.
