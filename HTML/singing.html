      <i>"I feel genuinely lucky to have met Bryan. He has me singing songs and notes that scared the 
        heck out me before… and I'm singing them with ease! From the second you walk into his studio 
        for a lesson, Bryan has a way of making you feel comfortable. As the lessons proceed, you feel 
        confident, like you can sing anything. And with Bryan, you usually can.  And now we’re starting 
        harmonies which elevates every song.” – Jan G.</i>

      <p>“Make the instrument sing!” has been the advice of every great teacher. 
      But how about actual singing? </br></br>The human voice is the most versatile and convenient 
      instrument you will ever master. When one learns to sing with confidence life 
      gets a little easier and a lot more fun.</br></br>
      Regardless of your current level or ability, I can teach you to improve your singing, 
      whether solo, as part of a choral group or even a jazz choir.

          <p>In college I studied voice and sang with a variety of classical, jazz, and acapella choirs. 
          Over the past ten years I’ve been the featured vocalist with a dance band in Spokane. 
          I teach students how to breathe as a singer, how to stay on pitch, control their volume, 
          and how to “sell” their music to an appreciative audience.</p>
