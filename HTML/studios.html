      Country Road Studio, in North Idaho, is a fully equipped piano and keyboard studio with a comfortable waiting area
      for parents and ample parking. Heads up!  This studio is in a barn but you can keep your boots on. Also offered are
      voice and ukulele lessons. Additionally I teach part-time at Music City in Spokane.

      My studio in North Idaho, Country Road Studio, is equipped with a Yamaha Clavinova which replicates an acoustic piano.
      I use many of the extra features offered with this instrument to enhance the studentsâ€™ experiences during lessons.
      For students intent on composing or perhaps playing in a rock band (which I did on occasion over many years)
      I have two state-of-the-art electronic keyboards for teaching: a Nord Stage 2 and a Roland Jupiter 76.
      <br />
      My studio in Spokane, WA is within Music City, the number one place where people in the Inland Northwest
      go to buy acoustic and electronic keyboards. I have taught at Music City for the past 10 years. My Spokane studio
      is equipped with the latest Yamaha Clavinova on offer these days.
